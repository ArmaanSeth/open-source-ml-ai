## Goals! :checkered_flag:

The goal of this repository is to act as a resource for current and future learners who are interested in AI and ML, but do not have a proper understanding of the basics that go into ML algorithms.

Also, this repository aims to give you, the people viewing, a chance to contribute to this repo and get started on your open source contributions.
The goal is to create something impactful, that will have a lasting impact on not just you, but also the upcoming learners who happen to watch this resource repository over the years.

## Before you contribute :memo:

Please note that certain topics and issues may be a little advanced for absolute first time contributors. In that case, please only work on stuff that is convenient for you. 

And don't worry, there is something to contribute here for everyone. :smile:

## Contributions

Open-source contributions have large group of contributors working at once, so in order to avoid any duplication in pull requests, it is important to allocate tasks based on issues to community members and contributors. To get an idea about how to start and also see what all issues are available, or to create your own issue, check out the [Issues.md](/Issues.md) file and then move to the Issues tab of this repository.

All the specific details on how to contribute along with the step by step procedure for creating and pushing a pull request have been shown in the [Contributing.md](/Contributing.md) file.

## Remember the Code of Conduct:bangbang:

- Your contributions can be at a beginner level, but they should in some way, shape or form, add value to the repository, it is only then that the maintainer(s) of this repo may merge your pull request. With that being said, do not hesitate to send in a pull request as even that is a great hands-on experience you should try getting, especially as beginners.

- Do not copy code from online sites and post here especially for a little advanced topics.

- **Remember that it is not guaranteed that your contributions to this repository will count for your Hacktoberfest 2022 prizes.** Our goal is not to be a simple +1 to your hacktoberfest completion metric, our intent is to give you a brief and simple understanding of how open-source contributions work . **Please value learning and hands-on experience more than swags and goodies from online events!**

- **Do not forget to check out the `Issues` tab on this repo. There, you can find the Issues that are open and you can also ask to be alloted an issue or raise your own issues before proceeding with a pull request.**
